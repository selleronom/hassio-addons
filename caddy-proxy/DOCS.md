# Home Assistant Add-on: Caddy Home Assistant SSL proxy

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "Caddy Home Assistant SSL proxy" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

The Caddy Proxy add-on is commonly used in conjunction with the [Duck DNS](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/duckdns) add-on to set up secure remote access to your Home Assistant instance. The following instructions covers this scenario.

1. The certificate to your registered domain should already be created via [Duck DNS](https://github.com/home-assistant/addons/tree/master/duckdns) or another method. Make sure that the certificate files exist in the `/ssl` directory.
2. You must add the following section to your [Home Assistant configuration.yaml](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/):

   ```yaml
   http:
     use_x_forwarded_for: true
     trusted_proxies:
       - 172.30.33.0/24
   ```
3. In the Caddy addon configuration, change the `domain` option to the domain name you registered (from DuckDNS or any other domain you control).
4. Leave all other options as-is.
5. Save configuration.
6. Start the add-on.
7. Have some patience and wait a couple of minutes.
8. Check the add-on log output to see the result.
